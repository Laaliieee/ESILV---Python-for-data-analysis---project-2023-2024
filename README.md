# ESILV---Python-for-data-analysis---project-2023-2024

### Presentation

We do our project on Drug Consumption with the dataset published in the website UCI on 10/16/2016 (URL : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/373/drug+consumption+quantified). 

Indeed, drugs, whether legal or illegal, are a real scourge in our society given the behavioral, physical and psychological impacts of those who are dependent on them.

We try to follow an approach to see the impacts of the conusmption of drug on people with variables given in the dataset such as : extravartion, neuroticism, openness to experience, agreeableness, conscientiousnes, impulsivity and sensation seeing.

Our study also focuses on other characteristics that can drive or explain drug use: age, ethnicity, country, gender and education.

We have chosen to respond through this notebook to different problems: 

- **Can a person's gender be predicted only through their drug consumption habits.**
- **Can the gender of a person be predicted through all the parameters of the dataset**
- **Drug use based on personality analysis**

This dataset allows us to apply differents method of prediction :

- RandomForestClassifier
- DecisionTreeClassifier
- KNeighborsClassifier
- LogisticRegression
